			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>My calculator works with a 5-key scheme, using the arrow keys as directional input and the enter key to select an item.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Calculator buttons can be traversed with the four arrow keys. Up, down, left and right boundaries can all be crossed. </li>
        </ul>
				<h2>Testing</h2>
				<div>For my test, I decided to compare the efficiency of using one hand to control the interface versus using both of my feet. To compare efficiency, I first prepared an equation to solve:</div>
        <li>What is 49393932 + 2001 - 201231?</li>
        <li>One handed result: 29s</li>
        <li>Two foot result: 2m 41s</li>
        <h3>Analysis of Results</h3>
        <li>Wow, okay, I learned a lot from actually doing that with my feet. Arrow keys are too small. I wouldve much rather have been using a two or even one key interface. In addition, the enter key is in a weird spot in relation to the arrow keys - having two feet didn't help at all. I just ended up using one foot. Also, my screen went everywhere. I didn't have the same precision I have with my hands, instead I was pressing the arrow keys so many times that my screen was scrolling out of place, I couldn't even see my calculator at some points. I decided to just ignore that for the most part, and continue typing. The reason it took so long is because I messed up a lot, and then went very slow to ensure I did it correctly. In conclusion, I don't very much like the key interface I designed. It seems like it solves no problems, except for making things potentially more convenient for the average user. </li>
